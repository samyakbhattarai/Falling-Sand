Some help being taken from ChatGPT (mainly to implement the color functionality)
<h5>The file is written in C with implementation using the SDL library.</h5>

<h2>Working</h2>
the <b>CreateGrain</b> function is used to create a grain of sand on x,y co-ordinates on the screen.
the <b>HandleMouseClick</b> function to generate new grains at that registered x,y co-ordinates
